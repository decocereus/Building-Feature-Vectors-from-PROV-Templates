# Make sure the latest version of Python is installed on your system.

# For mac this can be by opening your terminal and executing

$ python -V

# To run the script navigate to directory where you downloaded the script.

# type $ python3 script.py in your terminal or command propmpt.

# Once you do this you should get a propmt which asks for a file path.

# This file path should point to the provenance template you want to use.

# Another prompt will greet asking for a depth, make sure you enter an integer.

# After executing all the steps correctly you should get the feature vector printed in the terminal.
